Module Name:

    Driver.c

Abstract:

    Main module.

    This driver is for Open System Resources USB-FX2 Learning Kit designed
    and built by OSR specifically for use in teaching software developers how to write
    drivers for USB devices.

    The board supports a single configuration. The board automatically
    detects the speed of the host controller, and supplies either the
    high or full speed configuration based on the host controller's speed.

    The firmware supports 3 endpoints:

    Endpoint number 1 is used to indicate the state of the 8-switch
    switch-pack on the OSR USB-FX2 board. A single byte representing
    the switch state is sent (a) when the board is first started,
    (b) when the board resumes after selective-suspend,
    (c) whenever the state of the switches is changed.

    Endpoints 6 and 8 perform an internal loop-back function.
    Data that is sent to the board at EP6 is returned to the host on EP8.

    For further information on the endpoints, please refer to the spec
    http://www.osronline.com/hardware/OSRFX2_32.pdf.

    Vendor ID of the device is 0x4705 and Product ID is 0x210.

Environment:

    Kernel mode only

Routine Description:
    DriverEntry initializes the driver and is the first routine called by the
    system after the driver is loaded.

Parameters Description:

    DriverObject - represents the instance of the function driver that is loaded
    into memory. DriverEntry must initialize members of DriverObject before it
    returns to the caller. DriverObject is allocated by the system before the
    driver is loaded, and it is released by the system after the system unloads
    the function driver from memory.

    RegistryPath - represents the driver specific path in the Registry.
    The function driver can use the path to store driver related data between
    reboots. The path does not store hardware instance specific data.

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS if successful,
    STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL or another NTSTATUS error code otherwise.
